# SkinDetection_NaiveBayes

This project implements a **skin detection algorithm** using **Naive Bayes** with cross-validation. The goal is to accurately classify skin and non-skin pixels in images.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Utilizes a probabilistic approach for skin detection.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures the model's robustness and generalization.
- **Java Implementation**: Entire project is coded in Java.

## Files

- **ConfusionMatrix.java**: Computes and displays the confusion matrix.
- **CrossValidation.java**: Handles the cross-validation process.
- **Main.java**: Entry point of the application.
- **SkinDetection.java**: Core logic for skin detection.
- **TrainingMachine.java**: Manages the training of the Naive Bayes classifier.
